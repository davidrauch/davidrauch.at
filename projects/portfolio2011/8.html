<h1>Personal account on the last semester</h1>
<p>From my point of view, the last semester was divided into four main parts:</p>
<p>The first major topic was the possible separation of Northern Sudan and Southern Sudan. I liked this topic because it informed me about a current issue I had never heard of before. By doing so, this topic combined teaching a language with applying it to learn something else - which is, in my opinion, one of the best ways to learn a language.</p>
<p>The second topic we dealt with was the book The Scientific American: A Day in the Life of your Brain. In a way, it was very similar to dealing with Sudan because it also combined the process of learning english (in this case mostly scientific terms) with learning something else. However, I would have liked to spend more time on this topic.</p>
<p>I do not believe that it is a good idea to let every student read one chapter and then tell him/her to comment on all the others because he/she doesn't have the knowledge to do so. I am not an expert on the human brain, which means that if somebody summarizes a chapter I have not read and he/she writes that we get tired because of a hormone called "dopamine" (which is completely wrong), I have to believe it. If I had actually read the chapter myself, I could give more informed and therefore more productive feedback.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to suggest a different approach: Every student reads 3 chapters. He/She summarizes one of them and comments on the summaries of the other two chapters (which are written by other students). This is not more work, but it produces far better feedback.</p>
<p>The next topic was eXeLearning. I have already commented on this activity before, so I will not write about it again. Overall, I have to say that I like eLearning, but eXe is clearly the wrong approach.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I did a lot of work for EYP. Again, I dealt with my work on EYP before (in both my test and my creative feedback), so I will cut it short: Over the past year, EYP has become one of my favorite activities, and if I had had the choice to stay, I would still be in Istanbul.</p>
