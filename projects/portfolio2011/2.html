<h1>Presentation on Elections</h1>
<p>Elections are the key to democracy because they symbolize that all the power derives from the people. Because the voters are in such a powerful position, it is important that the ballots are treated confidential. Public ballots might increase the public's interest in voting (mostly because of peer pressure), but the same peer pressure may also influence the result of the election.</p>
<p>The highest office in a democracy is the Head of State. In a presidential system, the legislature and the Head of State are elected separately, while in a prime ministerial system, they are elected commonly. Also, the judiciary has all the judicial power, which means that it should not be elected directly by the people because then it might be influenceable.</p>
<p>When it comes to the election itself, there are different opinions on how often people should be allowed to vote for a new government. More frequent elections enable a more responsive government, but they might be a problem in the implementation of long-term solutions. It is also important to know who is allowed to vote. In most countries, children, criminals who are in prison and residential aliens are not allowed to vote. The definition of "children" differs from country to country, but in recent years, many countries have lowered the active voting age because of declining voter's turnout.</p>
<p>Many people tend to forget that the result of an election does not only depend on how people voted, but also on the electoral system itself. There are three major electoral systems:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Plurality vote:</b> This system, which is used in the US and UK, divides the country into single-member constituencies of roughly equal size. The party that has the majority of votes in a constituency is able to nominate its representative. This system is more likely to produce a single-party government, but it can also produce disproportionate outcomes.</li>
	<li><b>Alternative vote:</b> This system is used in Australia, and it enables voters to sort candidates according to preference. It produces a more accurate and proportional result, but it tends to underrepresent small parties.</li>
	<li><b>The Party List:</b> This system is used in continental Europe. It allows voters to vote on a party, which is then allowed to nominate a number of representatives so that the proportion of delegates in the parliament is roughly equal to the proportion of total votes. It produces the most accurate representation, but it does not enable voters to vote on a single person.</li>
