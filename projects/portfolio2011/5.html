<h1>The Human Brain</h1>

<h2>7PM: Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance</h2>

<p>After a long day, the human brain wants music. This has a long history - humans have been making music since the dawn of culture, playing bone flutes and jaw harps while dancing and singing along.</p>

<p>Of all our sensory organs, the ear has the fewest sensory cell - only 3500 small hairs occupy the ear. As there is no specialized section of the brain for music, it is spread all over the brain. This might be the reason why the sense for music has been proven to survive brain damage. There are even famous composers who were not only deaf (Beethoven) but also had brain damage, such as Maurice Ravel. Also, the rule that the right brain is the more creative one does not apply to music that strictly.</p>

</p>As the brain generally enjoys music, a lot of stores use background music to cheer up their costumers and get them into the right mood. This even works with people who say that they are not very musical. Humans are Born to Rock, and a musical expertise is developed by hard training, not given by birth.</p>
