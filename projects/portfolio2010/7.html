				<h1>Shopping in Washington</h1>
				<p>You can't shop in Washington. That's why we headed for a shopping center in Virginia as we wanted to buy some clothes. When we arrived, Dominik and I where clearly impressed by the size of the shopping center, even though the Walmart across the street probably was at least as large as all those single shops combined. It was not the size of single shops that fascinated us - it was the sheer amount of different shops that thrilled us. </p>
				<p>Even though I'm a person who usually doesn't "shop" for clothes (I like funny T-Shirts, that's about it), I really enjoyed the day. I especially like the Levi's store, where I bought Jeans and a jacket. I also visited the Gap just for the sake of saying "I was at the Gap".</p>
				<h1>Shopping in New York</h1>
				<p>Shopping in New York was much different from the Washington shopping experience. The impression I had was that it is really easy to get something to eat (as long as you are not in Chinatown), but finding an ATM is almost impossible. When we looked for one, we ended up somewhere in Wall Street, and the ATM could not determine my account balance. After several minutes of demonstrating my superior hacking-skills (I was shouting at the ATM), I finally managed to obtain some cash.</p>
				<p>Another shop that was very hard to find was some sort of electric supply shop. We found a Best Buy, but every Austrian <em>Media Markt</em> is at least as big as the American Best Buy was.</p>
				<p>Overall, shopping in the US was really interesting, as there are so many different shops. You can find shops for everything, no matter how extraordinary, but it can be really hard to find basic supplies in a big city such as New York. We actually had problems finding a normal grocery store as we only found pharmacies, and when we finally found one, it closed at 10 PM. In America, that's almost unacceptable to many people.</p>
