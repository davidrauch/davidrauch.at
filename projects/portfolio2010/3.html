				<h1>Blog - Patriotism in the US</h1>
				<p>Now that I am back from the US, there are two things I want to talk about.<br />The first one is nationalism and patriotism.</p>
				<p>In my experience, even liberal Americans are extremely proud of their country. Most of them have the American Flag in front of their houses, many of them know all verses of the national anthem, and what bothered me most: All their kids learn and swear the Pledge of Allegiance in School. Every Day.</p>
				<p>What really fascinated me was that the people who really lose because of the system apparently like it the most. I have never seen so many homeless people wearing american flags...</p>
				<p>The USA always describes itself as the "Land of the Free", but I witnessed quite the contrary. You can not visit a single museum without going through an airport-level security scan, you see police cars on every crossroad, and you are obligated to swear allegiance to your country every day. The moment I saw a student running through the hall being stopped not because he was running, but just because he had to swear the Pledge, I dropped my last hope that the american students were - in any form - "free".</p>
				<p>As Benjamin Franklin once said: "He who would trade liberty for some temporary security, deserves neither liberty nor security."</p>
				<p>Now to something more positive: The american people are extremely friendly and generous, which somehow conflicts with the nationalism I mentioned above, but enough of that. I really liked that people offered help just because we were studying the subway map, or simply because we looked lost. Also, the waiters in the restaurants were the most obligingly ones I ever met. Probably this has something to do with the fact that most of their payments are tips, but it still was nice. Also, the students and teachers at Chantilly were very welcoming. After we swore the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>
