A collection of random stuff I've worked on. Not complete, not always up to date, but hey.

## EYP Member Management ([GitHub](https://github.com/eyp-developers/eyp-member-database))

A web-application developed for [EYP Austria](http://www.eypaustria.org) and other National Committees of the [EYP](http://eyp.org). The application is designed as a bare-bones core, most features are realised as plugins. This makes it very configurable and fast.

## GermanC ([GitHub](https://github.com/davidrauch/GermanC))

A handful of defines that allow you to write C in German. Full of Umlauts and ÃŸ. Because why not.

## Subscriptions.app ([GitHub](https://github.com/davidrauch/Subscriptions))

A (now defunct) Mac app that showed the latest videos of your YouTube Subscriptions and played the videos in your favourite local media player. Built out of frustration because YouTube kept changing and hiding the Subscriptions page.

## Meneux.app ([GitHub](https://github.com/davidrauch/Meneux))

A (now defunct) Mac app client for [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com). It used to sit in your menu bar and pop up to show you today's todos.
