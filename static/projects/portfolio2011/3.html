<h1>Proposal on Sudan</h1>

<p><b>To:</b> Prof. Birgit Walzl<br />
<b>From:</b> David Rauch<br />
<b>Topic:</b> Independence of Southern Sudan</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Northern and Southern Sudan have been at war for decades, and even though they are now (officially) at peace and Southern Sudan has had some autonomy since 2005, a referendum for independence that is currently held might cause new tensions. This proposal aims to inspect the problems and give a possible solution.</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li>The voting for independence has been highly successful. A week before the referendum was held, nobody really believed that it would take place. Then, when it took place, the participation quickly reached 60%, making it a valid vote.</li>
<li>Even though the final results will not be available until February 15th, early results clearly show that most people voted for independence. The numbers reported vary between 90% and 99% for different states, but there is not a single state with less than 80% positive votes.</li>
<li>Even if Southern Sudan decides to form it’s own country, this can not take place until July 9th, when the peace agreement between north and south expires.</li>
<li>If Southern Sudan would form it’s own country in July, the hard job of building a working legal and political base for a country would have to take place in the rainy season, when most of the country’s infrastructure is useless.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Separation is never a good idea, but South Sudan has every right to form a new country. They have been bond to and exploited by their northern neighbors for years even though they do not share significant cultural habits. In retrospect, it might have been better to form a separate country in 2005 instead of legally binding the two parts to stay one country when negotiating the peace treaty, but hindsight is always easier than foresight.</p>

<p>Southern Sudan has enormous resources, especially oil. When setting up a constitution, it is extremely important that these resources are declared to be owned by the state on behalf of the people and that money earned from these resources will be used to build schools, infrastructure and other public institutions. Otherwise, the new country will soon be the playground of big companies, as so many other African countries have been before.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, my advice is to let South Sudan form it’s own country ruled by a democratically elected government. This new country should use it’s natural resources to build the required infrastructure for a successful future.</p>

<blockquote>"Southern Sudanese election officials posted early results on Sunday indicating that perhaps more than 95 percent of voters in this regional capital voted to secede from Sudan. The referendum, held last week, was the capstone of decades of civil war in Sudan, which pitted Christian and animist rebels in the south against Arab rulers in northern Sudan."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The people of southern Sudan have waited for this moment for six years. In fact, they have been waiting for 10 times that. People here have had their hopes dashed so often that they scarcely dared believe it could happen. Even as recently as a month ago, many doubted the vote would happen at all."</blockquote>
