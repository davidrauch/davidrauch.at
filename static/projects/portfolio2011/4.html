<h1>Feedback on eXeLearning</h1>

<p>I am a big fan of digitally available learning material because it is easy to distribute and access. However, most people who produce digital content don't get the fact that it is a completely different medium.</p>

<p>Because of this, I think that it is not a good idea to simply digitalize Content from a printed book. A printed book is not a computer display, the same way a horse is not a car. Content has to be produced especially for digital media, and that also applies to schoolbooks.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that it is better to ask students to find digital content or create digital content on their own (why not bundle an entire Unit into a 10 minute video?) rather than forcing them to use crappy software which seems as if it was built to simply digitalize books. Basically, it is the same story as with the e-portfolio: I love to create digital, online portfolios; But please let me choose how I do it.</p>
