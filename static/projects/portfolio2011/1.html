<h1>Introduction to the Reader</h1>
<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>Yes, this is a portfolio. It's content is not so different from any other portfolio, yet it is special. Do you want to know why it is special?</p>
<p>It's special because I made it special. It is an own website, it has it's own design, it's own navigation, even it's own hidden features.</p>
<p>After having had a lot of fun creating my last portfolio, which was mainly a collection of single webpages, I decided to go a step further and make the portfolio more interactive. So I added some Javascript-magic to dynamically load single articles without reloading the entire page and I sugar-coated it with some neat animations (as alway, newer browser = better experience).</p>
<p>Another thing that makes this portfolio special is that I am genuinely proud of it. I love the freedom of creating a portfolio however I want, because it enables me to combine my portfolio-work with learning techniques I wanted to learn for quite a while. In this specific example, I wanted to extend my knowledge of Javascript, so I decided to build this interactive page rather than linking a set of static pages. And the result really makes me proud.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I want to say the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I really appreciate that, after 4 years, I finally have the opportunity to create my portfolio the way I want.</li>
	<li>I think that it generally increases student's motivation to create a nice portfolio if they have the possibility to make it special - to create something of their own. And, as the medium is part of the message, I strongly believe that allowing them to choose the medium is a very important part in this process - especially in first and second classes.</li>
</ul>
