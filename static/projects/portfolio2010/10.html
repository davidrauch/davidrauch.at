				<h1>High School Integration</h1>
				<h3>General Atmosphere</h3>
				<p>I had the feeling that the general atmosphere in American High Schools is more disciplined that it is in Austria. As an example, coming too late is a total no-go because you can&#39;t even enter the school at certain times. Also, the sheer presence of a police car in front of the school makes a huge difference.
In class, the behavior of student&#39;s mostly depends on their teacher. Some teachers do not allow discussions or arguments, while other&#39;s encourage their students to talk openly.
On the other hand, student&#39;s have free learning hours and the library as well as the lunch room are used for private discussions.</p>
				<h3>Differences to the Austrian Schools</h3>
				<p>In my opinion, an American High School is mostly comparable to an Austrian secondary schools. The student&#39;s don&#39;t have free periods (except supervised learning periods), and most teachers treat them as if they were younger. This might also be the case because I mostly visited Freshmen classes, so most of my colleagues where just starting out in High School.</p>
				<p>Of course I was also fascinated by the size of the school, but I think that you get used to it. When I started in Kaindorf, I also was stunned by a school having more students than my home village has inhabitants, but know it&#39;s no big deal. As all the organizational work in split up across four subschools, you still have the possibility to talk to an authority without waiting for hours.</p>
				<h3>One lesson in particular</h3>
				<p>The lesson I enjoyed most was &quot;creative writing&quot;, which is an optional subject. In the lesson I visited, we had a so-called &quot;share-lesson&quot;, in which everybody reads out a text he/she recently worked on and all the other students listen and give feedback. I really enjoyed this because I got the chance to listen to all those wonderful texts. In most other periods, I did not have the feeling that the students were particularly interested in the subject, but in creative writing, they all had such creative and well written texts, and they all provided constructive feedback.</p>
				<p>We also wrote a text on our favorite child&#39;s game. I wrote mine about my old N64, which I bought when it was already outdated, but I still loved it.</p>
				<h3>The American Students</h3>
				<p>American students are actually not that different from Austrian students. They have subjects they like (in which they participate), and subjects they don&#39;t like. Also, their behavior mostly depends on the kind of behavior that is accepted by the teacher. There are also the students who give bold answers to teachers and the ones who would never dare to do so.</p>
				<p>Overall the American students are very similar to Austrian ones, with the one difference that they are, as most Americans, more welcoming and open minded than the average Austrian student. Also, as they are not in fixed classes, they get to know more of their colleagues.</p>
