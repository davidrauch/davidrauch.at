				<h1>Personal Account</h1>
				<p>It is hard to really know a person you met just a week ago, but one of the things I knew immediately when I saw my hostfamily was that they are very open and welcoming people. Not twenty minutes later, my hostmother told me that they had hostet several austrian and dutch students before. On the one hand, I liked that they had experience in hosting students, but on the other hand, what can you tell somebody about Austria who already heard all the facts you normally tell foreign people?</p>
				<p>We still got talking, and I really enjoyed it. In fact, one of my favorite activities in Washington was simply talking to people. It didn't matter if we talked about American politics, football, or simply how stupid the imperial system is. By the way: I did not meet a single person who said that they would be against replacing the imperial system by the metric system. Most young Americans even learn both systems in High School.</p>
				<p>Another Thing I enjoyed a lot was shopping. I think that you can learn a lot about a culture by simply having a look at their grocery stores. In the case of America, a simple label i saw on a pack of ham probably told me more about the country and the people than many American's could have told me: <b><em>"97% non-fat"</em></b>.</p>
				<p>I experienced Americans as very polite people, but also as people who tend to by very indirect. Who don't you say 3% fat? Well, 97% non-fat simply is the American way of saying it. It might be confusing in the beginning, but I really liked the positive attitude.</p>
