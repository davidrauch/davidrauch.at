				<h3>Test: Correction</h3>
				<h4>1. Listening Input and Report</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>The first one is called "The Honeymoon" and can be described as the extremely good mood you are in when you first arrive at a new place.</li>
				<li>After that, I also noticed that Americans are extremely polite and friendly, which sometimes makes them appear fake.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>2. Text</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Also, the overall frustration in America that goes hand in hand with every economical downturn is a big reason for voters to turn to the opposition, especially when the party in power seems to be unable not only to present their idea to the voters, but also seems to struggle with internal communication.</li>
					<li>First of all, I think that you and your party have done a lot for America within the last two years, and I am also positive that you did not deserve this wave election, but I also agree with some critical points I read in today's <em>Newsweek</em></li>
					<li>Another advice I want to give you is to think about your party's image. The Democratic Party always seemed kind of chaotic to me, struggling with internal as well as external organization.</li>
					<li>How can you expect to communicate your message to millions of voters when even your closest colleagues have stopped listening to it.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>3. Personal Account</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>First of all, I experienced that host families are very interested in the Austrian culture, so be sure to visit America packed with knowledge. If you, however, are in a family that has already hosted several students and therefore already knows a lot about Austria (which happened to me), it is your task to ask questions and encourage conversation if you want to talk and improve your speaking.</li>
					<li>When you visit high school, one rule that is always important at school becomes fundamental: be polite.</li>
					<li>Places you must/should see include the Empire State Building (at night!), Central Park, Battery park (also at night, you have a beautiful view of New Jersey), Times Square and all the flagship shops, such as the ones by Nintendo, M&Ms, Toys'R'us and Hershey's.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Test: Comment</h3>
				<p><b>Regarding the comment: <em>... I tend to read sentences twice ...</em></b>:<br>In the weeks before the test, I did a lot of research on American politics. I read articles, studied analysis and watched interviews. Because I came across a lot of useful phrases, the political texts almost wrote themselve.</p>
				<p><b>Regarding the comment: <em>... I am starting to wonder whether you might have come across this phrase somewhere ...</em></b>:<br>I think I read this phrase on some American blog, but I think that the article in which it was used was written in a very informal style. In fact, I think it was a rant rather than a real article, so the phrase might by colloquial or slang.</p>
