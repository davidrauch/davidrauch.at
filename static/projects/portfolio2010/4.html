				<h1>Report - American TV Media</h1>
				<p>When I headed for the US, I had the plan to find out if my ideas about American TV were accurate or not. I wanted to investigate whether simple TV shows really had substantial influence in election results, or if the American TV Shows I knew were simply overdrawn. This report will express my findings as wells as my personal opinion.</p>
				<p>First of, I have to say that TV is still extremely popular in the US. Even though many people get most of their news from the Internet, television is still very important. In addition, many big television companies now utilize new media, such as the internet, to reach more people. They not only offer their normal videos online for instant on-demand access, they also produce videos and show concepts especially for their online platforms. Also, many of them use platforms such as YouTube, FaceBook or Twitter to connect to their viewers. Some shows offer their viewers the possibility to participate in the shows they watch by sending direct feedback via Twitter, others integrate YouTube comments into their show.</p>
				<p>While all these measures offer the possibility to provide a more interactive experience for the viewer, in the end they all seem somehow unnatural. TV is, and has ever been a one-way medium. There are companies who can afford to produce and distribute their content, and there are people who support them by watching their shows. Other means of communication, such as the Internet, have especially been designed to be synchronous. Everybody may consume and produce as he or she wishes. Using the internet to receive feedback while sending on TV is always a half-baked solution.</p>
				<p>Politically, TV Stations differ depending on the companies that own them. Most of Rupert Murdochs Stations, which includes all FOX-Companies, are rather conservative, while many public stations, as well as those owned by Viacom, are more liberal. MSNBC is an exception to this tendency, as it is more liberal and left-wing even though it is owned by Microsoft and General Electric, who donated 1.1 and 2.4 million to G.W.Bush&#39;s election campaign.</p>
				<p>As all these stations are convinced of their opinion, they often pick on each other, showing clips of the other station&#39;s show and critically commenting on it. One man who perfected this technique is Jon Steward, who, together with his writers, manages to fill a 30-minute-show every day by doing nothing but picking apart all the serious channel&#39;s shows while being basically untouchable because his shows is aired on Comedy Central. Whenever another anchorman criticizes him, he says something like: &quot;Come on, what do you expect? My follow-up are the Muppets!&quot;</p>
				<p>Overall, one can say that the American TV landscape is clearly divided. There are traditional TV news, anti-media comedy shows and internet-only shows that compete with their TV pendants. While their political opinions may differ and none of them might be completely balanced and neutral, they all have their target group and therefore are relevant to the way Americans live their life and perceive the life of others.</p>
